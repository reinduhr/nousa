All they agree is that the starting point will be in Croatia, where Jeremy arrives in an Audi TT RS, Richard turns up with a not-at-all-comparable Ariel Nomad, and James brings along an old Lada which he has decided to turn into a fire engine. What follows is a demonstration of why some kind of script is generally a good thing. Also in this show, Richard takes the new McLaren 720S to the Eboladrome and in Celebrity Face Off Michael Ball goes head-to-head against Alfie Boe to find the world's fastest classical singer with an interesting connection to the British motor industry.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May are in the vast Chinese megacity of Chongqing with some valuable consumer advice for business people across all of China; don't spend huge sums on a brand new luxury car when you could pop over to Europe, buy a second-hand executive limo and ship it home for a fraction of the cost. To prove their point, the three hosts tour the city and beyond in an old Mercedes S600, an ageing BMW 750iL and a 20-year-old Cadillac STS, encountering a door empire, a sinister camera network, a flame spitting drone and a range of in-car entertainment features along the way. Chongqing is regarded by many as the Detroit of China, and sources suggest that the boys will be filming a piece investigating the industrial development of the city's car industry. Clarkson will also be testing the Hongqi L5 Limousine – something he was very much looking forward to. Also in this show, The Grand Tour discovers an ultra-fast electric supercar called the NIO EP9 and foolishly gives the job of testing it to Richard Hammond.</p>",
