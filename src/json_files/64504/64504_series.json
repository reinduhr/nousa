  "summary": "<p><b>The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live</b> presents an epic love story of two characters changed by a changed world. Kept apart by distance. By an unstoppable power. By the ghosts of who they were. Rick and Michonne are thrown into another world, built on a war against the dead... And ultimately, a war against the living. Can they find each other and who they were in a place and situation unlike any they've ever known before? Are they enemies? Lovers? Victims? Victors?â€¯Without each other, are they even alive -- or will they find that they, too, are the Walking Dead?</p>",
